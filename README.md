# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-With-Raspberry-Pi
In this project, we will learn how we can build our face Recognition using the open CV library on RaspberryPi. The tutorial involved two parts; first part is a Trainer program, which analyzed a set of photos of a particular person and create dataset, the second part is the Recognizer program, which detects a face and recognize the face and mention the person name.
